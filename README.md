# brew-sync

> Keep your Homebrew packages synchronized across multiple Macs

## What does it do?

**The Problem**: You have multiple Macs and want the same apps and tools on all of them.

**The Solution**: Two simple commands that backup and restore everything.

```bash
# On your first Mac
brew-sync backup

# On your second Mac  
brew-sync restore
```

That's it! All your Homebrew packages, GUI apps, and Mac App Store apps are now synchronized.

## Key Features

- **üîÑ Multi-Mac sync**: Combines packages from all your machines
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Auto storage**: Works with iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, Git
- **üì± Complete coverage**: Homebrew + Cask apps + Mac App Store apps  
- **üè∑Ô∏è Profiles**: Different setups for work, personal, development
- **üîç Preview mode**: `--dry-run` to see what will be installed
- **‚ö° Simple**: Just `backup` and `restore` - auto-detects everything
