# brew-sync

> Keep your Homebrew packages synchronized across multiple Macs

## What does it do?

**The Problem**: You have multiple Macs and want the same apps and tools on all of them.

**The Solution**: Two simple commands that backup and restore everything.

```bash
# On your first Mac
brew-sync backup

# On your second Mac  
brew-sync restore
```

That's it! All your Homebrew packages, GUI apps, and Mac App Store apps are now synchronized.

## Key Features

- **Smart setup**: First-time interactive setup with intelligent defaults
- **Multi-Mac sync**: Organized by profiles for different use cases  
- **Flexible storage**: iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, Git, or local-only
- **Local option**: `.brew-sync` for single-Mac or privacy-conscious users
- **Complete coverage**: Homebrew + Cask apps + Mac App Store apps  
- **Profiles**: Different setups for work, personal, development
- **Machine-specific defaults**: Automatically loads per-machine default profile
- **Safe profile editing**: Edit package lists with diff preview and confirmation
- **Backup history**: View and rollback to previous backup versions
- **Interactive rollback**: Select from backup history with simple numbered menu
- **Clean CLI interface**: Minimal output by default, detailed with `--verbose`
- **Smart help system**: Context-aware help with `--help` for most commands
- **Preview mode**: `--dry-run` to see what will be installed/restored
- **History management**: Automatic cleanup of old backups with configurable retention
- **Simple**: Just `backup` and `restore` - auto-detects everything
- **Auto-migration**: Existing host-based setups automatically migrate to profiles

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyungw00k/brew-sync/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Basic Usage

### First Run (Interactive Setup)
```bash
# On first run, brew-sync guides you through setup
brew-sync backup

# üç∫ Welcome to brew-sync!
# Choose your backup storage location:
#
#  1) Git Repository üîÑ Version control and manual sync
#  2) iCloud Drive (recommended for multiple Macs) üì± 
#  3) Local storage (.brew-sync) üíª Stays on this Mac only
#
# Select storage (1-3, press Enter for 2): 
#
# After storage setup, you'll configure your default profile:
#
# üîß Profile Setup
#
# Found existing profiles:
# Profiles (icloud):
# default      2024-12-15T14:32:10+09:00    brew(85) cask(15) mas(12)
# work         2024-12-14T09:15:42+09:00    brew(67) cask(8) mas(5)
#
# Setup options:
# 1) Use 'default' profile (recommended)
# 2) Use existing profile from list above
# 3) Create new profile based on hostname ('MacBook-Pro')
# 4) Enter custom profile name
#
# Select option (1-4): 
```

### Daily Usage
```bash
# Backup packages (minimal output by default)
brew-sync backup
brew-sync backup --verbose     # Show detailed progress

# Restore packages (always preview first!)
brew-sync restore --dry-run    # Preview first (recommended)
brew-sync restore              # Actually install
brew-sync restore --verbose    # Show installation details

# Use profiles for different setups
brew-sync backup work
brew-sync restore work

# Note: Commands without profile use your default profile
# (configured per-machine in ~/.config/brew-sync/default_profile)

# Profile management commands
brew-sync status                   # List all profiles
brew-sync status work              # Show details of work profile
brew-sync edit work                # Edit work profile packages safely
brew-sync edit                     # Edit default profile or select one
brew-sync set work                 # Set work as default profile
brew-sync remove old               # Remove old profile (except 'default')

# History and rollback
brew-sync history                  # Show backup history for default profile
brew-sync history work             # Show backup history for specific profile
brew-sync rollback                 # Interactive rollback for default profile
brew-sync rollback work 2          # Rollback work profile to 2nd backup
brew-sync update               # Update to latest version
brew-sync update --check       # Check for updates only
brew-sync uninstall            # Uninstall brew-sync
brew-sync help                 # Get help

# Get detailed help for specific commands  
brew-sync backup --help         # Show backup options and usage
brew-sync restore --help        # Show restore options and usage
brew-sync <command> --help      # Most commands support --help

# Commands with --help support (10 out of 13 commands):
# backup, restore, status, history, rollback, edit, set, remove, cleanup, update
# Note: 'help' shows all commands, 'uninstall' and 'profile' (deprecated) are without --help
```

## Profile Editing

The `profile edit` feature lets you safely modify your package lists with a diff-based approach:

```bash
# Edit your work profile
$ brew-sync edit work
Editing profile 'work'

Press any key to continue...

# After editing and saving in your editor:
Brewfile edited successfully

Changes to be applied to profile 'work':

INSTALL:
  + brew "htop"
  + cask "notion"

REMOVE:
  - brew "bat"  

Apply these changes? [y/N]: y
Installing brew package: htop
Installing cask: notion  
Removing brew package: bat
Package changes applied successfully
Profile 'work' updated with your changes
Profile 'work' synchronized successfully
```

### Key Benefits
- **Safe editing**: Edit a temporary copy, not your actual profile
- **Smart preview**: See exactly what will be installed/removed before applying
- **User control**: Confirm changes before any system modifications
- **Package-specific**: Only install/remove the exact packages you changed
- **No surprises**: No aggressive cleanup that removes unrelated packages

### Usage Patterns
```bash
# Edit specific profile
brew-sync edit work

# Edit default profile (or select if none set)
brew-sync edit

# Typical workflow
brew-sync edit work        # Make your changes
# Review the preview carefully
# Type 'y' to apply or 'N' to cancel
```

## Backup History & Recovery

brew-sync automatically maintains a complete history of your backups, making it easy to recover from mistakes or revert to previous configurations.

### View Backup History
```bash
# Show all backups for default profile
brew-sync history

# Show all backups for work profile
brew-sync history work

# Output:
# Backup history for 'default':
# [1] 2d ago (103 packages)
# [2] 5d ago (98 packages)
# [3] 1w ago (95 packages)
# [4] 2w ago (92 packages)
# [5] 3w ago (90 packages)
```

### Rollback to Previous Backup
```bash
# Interactive rollback for default profile - shows menu to select
brew-sync rollback
# Select backup [1-5]: 2

# Interactive rollback for work profile - shows menu to select
brew-sync rollback work
# Select backup [1-5]: 2

# Direct rollback to specific backup
brew-sync rollback work 2

# Preview rollback without making changes
brew-sync rollback work 2 --dry-run
```

### Backup Management
```bash
# Preview backup changes
brew-sync backup work --dry-run

# Clean up old backups (keep only 5 most recent per profile)
brew-sync cleanup --keep-history 5

# Preview cleanup actions
brew-sync cleanup --keep-history 3 --dry-run
```

### Safety Features
- **Automatic backup**: Current state is automatically backed up before any rollback
- **User confirmation**: Always prompts before making changes
- **Preview mode**: `--dry-run` shows exactly what will happen
- **Smart retention**: Configurable history cleanup prevents unlimited storage growth

## Real-world example
